"""The Claude service on the bus: reads partner.text, dec.lock and dec.hyp, publishes claude.predict,
claude.repair and timing.claude (with every request and reply, for the logger).

One conversation-lane call at a time, so the conversation stays append-only (whatever arrives meanwhile goes into
the next one), and a repair-lane call for each dec.lock at once, up to brain.MAX_REPAIRS in flight (brain.py).
While the judge is still speaking, their partial line (Cartesia Ink) starts early prediction calls, one at a time, so
a prediction is ready before Austin starts mouthing (up to brain.MAX_EARLY in flight); the final line still goes
through the conversation lane.
While Austin mouths and nothing changed, the last claude.predict goes out again with a fresh ttl_s, without a call.
The bus loop never waits on Claude, and nothing that goes wrong (a malformed
message, a failed call, a reply that breaks apply) stops it: the error goes out on timing.claude and the
captions go on without Claude.

    python -m claude_service.service      # connects to 'dec' and 'call', binds 'claude'

The key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from the environment, else from call/keys.env (or call/.env), the git-ignored file that
already holds the call's keys, so every key lives in one place. Never in the repo or the logs.
