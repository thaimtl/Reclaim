"""Austin's voice: voice.say words -> Cartesia Sonic over one long-lived websocket -> mu-law audio for the call.

One Sonic context per utterance (utt_id), continue=True ("more to come"), the final message closes it, so speech starts
while Austin is still mouthing. Every chunk carries a leading space after the first and the last one closing
punctuation, so Sonic joins them as one sentence, in one continuous recording.

Phrases (the default, CARTESIA_PACED=1): Sonic only sounds like a person when it sees a few words together; a word sent
alone is said like a whole sentence (a test call: "spitting word by word"), and words cut from separate requests and
joined glitch. So locked words go to Sonic as natural phrases, each its own flush with no server buffer: when Austin
pauses (his decoder's dec.hyp shows nothing being mouthed, PHRASE_PAUSE_S; or no new word for PHRASE_IDLE_S), or after
PHRASE_WORDS words that don't end on a function word. Sonic pads each flush with ~0.5 s of silence; that is trimmed to a
natural pause (call/audio.py), and each phrase plays as soon as it arrives. Only locked words are ever spoken; the
pause signal is his own model's. Measured 2026-10-25 (sonic-3.6, a sentence mouthed in 5.5 s with two pauses): first
sound 0.6 s after he started, finished 1.0 s after him. With a 120 ms server buffer instead, Sonic held 14 of 15 words
until the sentence ended (4.9 s of silence).

Unpaced (CARTESIA_PACED=0): audio is played as it arrives, with the server buffer CARTESIA_MAX_BUFFER_MS, and
optionally words grouped client-side (CARTESIA_PHRASE_WORDS=3 with CARTESIA_MAX_BUFFER_MS=0).

Audio order: each utterance's audio goes into its own queue and one player task plays utterances in the order they
started, so two sentences never interleave on the phone, and on_done fires only after an utterance's last audio is
queued (the server puts a Twilio mark behind it).

Reconnect: the SDK's connection manager caches its first connection, so its own reconnect hands back the dead socket;
on a failed push we open a fresh connection ourselves and resend that phrase. Phrases of open utterances whose audio
had not arrived go to the fallback with the rest of their sentence (paced; unpaced, they are lost and logged).

Fallback (docs/REALTIME_PIPELINE.md: "If streaming voice glitches, the voice falls back to speaking whole sentences at
the end"): words whose streaming push still fails after the reconnect are kept, and when the utterance ends they are
spoken in one non-streaming request (tts.generate), after whatever did stream.

voice.say may carry only the new words or the whole utterance so far; Utterance.new_words() handles both, and an
explicit `offset` (index of the first word in the message) removes the guesswork when the decoder sends it.
Emotion comes from the newest cam.tick (Evan's camera reader); pace and effort from voice.say. All three go through
generation_config: emotion name, speed 0.6-1.5, volume 0.5-2.0, sent with every push (Cartesia's documented way to
change them mid-stream). Phrases: a change of face mid-sentence starts a new recording for the rest of it (Sonic keeps
one recording's mood); a clench is an inline <volume> on that word.
